# To-Do Application

## Features

- Add tasks: Enter your tasks into the input field and click the "Add" button to add them to your to-do list.
- Remove tasks: Each task has a "Remove" button that allows you to remove the task from the list when it's completed or no longer needed.
- Task organization: Tasks are displayed in a numbered list, making it easy to track and prioritize your tasks.
- Persistence: The application stores your tasks in the session, so you can close the browser and return to the application later with your tasks still intact.
